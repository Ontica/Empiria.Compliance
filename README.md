# Empiria Regulatory Compliance

Components suite for regulatory compliance management for governments and supervisory authorities
and their regulated entities.

As other Empiria products, these backend modules run over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions).

Also, it depends on many of the components of [Empiria Steps](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Steps),
our backend for process and project management.

These modules are extensions of [Empiria OnePoint](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.OnePoint), our software suite
that allow governments to provide services to people and organizations using a single point of contact.

Included modules are based on C# 8.0 and .NET Framework 4.8, and projects can be compiled using
Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.
